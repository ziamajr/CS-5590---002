In this assignment we were to:
 <ol>
 <li>Create GitHub Account. Create a repository in remote GitHub. Clone it to local machine. Create 2 (Source and Documentation) directories in local GitHub</li>
 <li>Take screenshots of a repository creation and put them in the documentation folderin the local repository and sync it to remote repository</li>
 <li>Create a html document named “index.html” and place it in the source folder. Inside the html document write a report explaining what you did</li>
 <li>Sync both local repository with the source and documentation folders with the remote repository</li>
 <li>Create a wiki page for your lab assignment through GitHub</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I first started by creating the GitHub repository on the GitHub website. Below is a image of how I did that.

<a href = "../Documentation/Repo Creation.jpg" target = "_blank">
<img width="220" height="250" border="0" align="center"  src="../Documentation/Repo Creation.jpg"/>
</a>

<p>
Then I download the windows app which made it all easy from there on.
Within the aoo you can also create a repository, but since I had created mine on the web I first logged into the app. Then clicked on the 
file men and clone repository. I copied my repository link from the GitHub webiste and paste that link. The set the desktop location
I wanted that link to be in. This way I can easily add stuff to my page and upload it and commit it when I am done and ready.
